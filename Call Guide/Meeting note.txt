I have 10 years of experience in web development. My primary stack is MERN, and I have worked on multiple enterprise projects such as Databricks and AtlasPower, building platforms using React. I also have experience in back-end development using Node/Express and Laravel. Additionally, I am proficient with CMS platforms such as BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Shopify, and WordPress.

Recently, I have focused on front-end development, excelling in building pixel-perfect and responsive UIs using React, Next.js, Svelte, Vue, Angular, and CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, MUI, and Ant Design.

I joined Upwork in 2017 and built a solid work history there. However, Upwork has a US-only market where US freelancers often command higher hourly rates. After the COVID-19 pandemic, more US freelancers joined Upwork, making it difficult for me to secure good and long-term jobs. As you know, US clients prefer to work with US freelancers despite their higher hourly rates due to the absence of language barriers and time zone differences.
Consequently, I closed my account to reassess my strategy and find a way to work on Upwork again.

I propose a collaboration where you create an Upwork account, and I will send proposals for jobs to secure projects. Once you have a video/audio call with the clients, they will likely hire you. If there is a technical interview, I can assist you with quick answers. I will handle the project work on my end.

We will aim for hourly contracts, such as $70 for 40 hours per week. The payment will be available in two weeks, managed through your bank or PayPal connected to the Upwork profile.

Initially, we may need to complete four small contracts (under $100) to build a reputation and receive a Job Success Score (JSS). With a 100% JSS, we can secure larger projects ($500 to $1,000) and eventually get highlighted for part-time or full-time hourly contracts.

There will be 2-3 interviews per week, each lasting 15-30 minutes, totaling around 90 minutes. I work 13-15 hours daily and will be fully available during US time zones.

Regarding compensation, I propose sharing 15% of the total earnings with you.

About using the Upwork account, I can't use your account on my end.
Using VPN or VM are both not allowed on Upwork so I hope you could turn on your extra laptop(if you have) for me and login Upwork account on chrome browser.
And I will use the Upwork account remotely using TeamViewer or AnyDesk(remote access)
I will use Chrome browser only but you can format the laptop before using if you want.
You can see my activity any time so you can let me stop uing when you detect strange actions but I guarantee that it will not happen.

I'm really serious about this business and am looking for a long-term partner to build a great profile and make much money.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

------what should we do at first?
Initially, we may need to complete four or five small contracts (under $100) to build a reputation and receive a Job Success Score (JSS). With a 100% JSS, we can secure larger projects ($500 to $1,000) and eventually get highlighted for part-time or full-time hourly contracts. 


------how can we handle tax problem?
we can create business equity like llc in this case
then All profits, money we earned from upwork are regarded as company compensation
so you can responsible only for tax in your part
if we earn money from upwork, you can give me money as a salary type
no need to pay tax in full part 
I think this is a good way to handle this problem
