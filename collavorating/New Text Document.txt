1. "welll, first of all i will be really sorry..."
Mistake: Extra "l" in "welll" and incorrect phrasing.
Correction: "Well, first of all, I want to say I'm really sorry..."

2. "...because my english is a little poor."
Mistake: "english" should be capitalized.
Correction: "...because my English is a little poor."

3. "so you should fix may speaking immediatly."
Mistake: "may" should be "my," and "immediatly" should be "immediately."
Correction: "So, you should fix my speaking immediately."

4. "thank you from now on you are my best brother."
Mistake: Missing punctuation and unnatural phrasing.
Correction: "Thank you! From now on, you're my best brother."

5. "let me introduce my self. i am bonggo. you must memorise it!"
Mistake: "my self" should be "myself," "i" should be capitalized, and "memorise" is British spelling (considering American spelling would use "memorize").
Correction: "Let me introduce myself. I am Bonggo. You must memorize it!"

6. "...as i have talked before i am making a projext..."
Mistake: "i" should be capitalized, and "projext" should be "project."
Correction: "As I mentioned before, I am making a project..."

7. "...but i cannot put the svg file into the search tag."
Mistake: "i" should be capitalized.
Correction: "...but I cannot put the SVG file into the search tag."

Mistake: Missing punctuation and capitalization.
Correction: "No, no, that's enough. I got it."

9. "well we have already speak a little i think,..."
Mistake: "speak" should be "spoken," and "well" should be followed by a comma.
Correction: "Well, we have already spoken a little, I think..."

10. "...what do you think about my english? am i like a native speaker?"
Mistake: "english" should be capitalized, and "am i" should be "Am I."
Correction: "What do you think about my English? Am I like a native speaker?"
