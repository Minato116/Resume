Hi ,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Bonggo, and I am a web developer seeking a collaborator for a unique and straightforward opportunity.

I’m looking for someone based in the United States who can assist me by handling video calls and interviews for Upwork projects on my behalf. You won’t need to do any technical work—your role would involve participating in these calls to represent the project as needed.

In return, I’m offering a fixed monthly payment of $3,000 for your time and effort. This is a simple and flexible arrangement, and I will provide you with all the necessary details and support to make this a smooth collaboration.

If this opportunity interests you, I’d be happy to discuss more and answer any questions you might have. Please feel free to reach out to me at your earliest convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
